-- Typically, element-testing functions are written to take the element
-- as the first argument and the set as the second argument. This is intentionally
-- written the other way for better performance when iterating over a collection.
-- For example, you might test elements in a list for membership like this:
--
-- >>> let r = IPv4Range (fromOctets 10 10 10 6) 31
-- >>> mapM_ (P.print . contains r) (take 5 $ iterate succ $ fromOctets 10 10 10 5)
-- False
-- True
-- True
-- False
-- False

-- The implementation of 'contains' ensures that (with GHC), the bitmask
-- creation and range normalization only occur once in the above example.
-- They are reused as the list is iterated.

-- | Normalize an 'IPv4Range'. The first result of this is that the
-- 'IPv4' inside the 'IPv4Range' is changed so that the insignificant
-- bits are zeroed out. For example:
--
-- >>> print $ normalize $ IPv4Range (fromOctets 192 168 1 19) 24
-- 192.168.1.0/24
-- >>> print $ normalize $ IPv4Range (fromOctets 192 168 1 163) 28
-- 192.168.1.160/28
--
-- The second effect of this is that the mask length is lowered to
-- be 32 or smaller. Working with 'IPv4Range's that have not been
-- normalized does not cause any issues for this library, although
-- other applications may reject such ranges (especially those with
-- a mask length above 32).
--
-- Note that 'normalize' is idempotent, that is:
--
-- prop> normalize r == (normalize . normalize) r
